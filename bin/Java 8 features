Question: What is Lambda Expression?
Anwser  : Lambda is anonymous function
		  * No Name
		  * No modifier
		  * No return type
		  
Benefits of lambda?
1) Reduces the line of code.(But only used with functional interface)
2) To call API's Very effectively (Jese hum stream api ke function use krte hai).
3) To write more Readable ,Maintainable and concise code.	 		  

Important Rules of lambda :
# If he body of Lambda expression contain only on statement then the curly braces are optional.
# If you pass the argument type (like int a, string b) in function then the type is also optional

Functional Interface: If the interface contains only one abstract method then it is called functional interface.
example: runnable, callable , camparable.
